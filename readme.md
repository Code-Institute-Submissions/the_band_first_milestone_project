The band project
----------------

Introduction
------------
This project is about a 1960s style band called the Monkees.
I have been asked to build a website of 4 or 5 pages showcasing the Monkees.  
The primary target audience is the bands fans who want a way to see where the panasonics are performing and to know more about the members of the band.
I will include a gallery of events, some sample tracks for download and a contact link.

The UX 
-------
I started by using the 5 planes framework to design the website and then did an overall conceptual diagram
and a wireframe for each page.  These can be found in the band planning document accessed by clicking on this link.  

My homepage
-------------

I started by setting up the nav elements using flexbox and then changed the colour picture to mono as 
the grey background was better suited to a mono picture.  The band is a 1960s style band so this seemed
more in line with trends.  I later decided to use a free background image from pixabay still staying with the mono theme.

I then added a menu - first I used flexbox and padded out the items.  However this looked very amateurish so I decided
to make my items go down the page, centering these, adding in a hover effect of a blue line underneath each item.  I then linked my pages together
using absolute filepaths.

My gallery page
---------------

This page was made up of a series of pictures showing past gigs for the band.
I created a responsive gallery showing pictures of the band from the past and present.

My Videos page
--------------

This page enabled the user to click on a video and view a past performance by the Monkees.
I embedded videos into this page from you tube.


My contact page
---------------
I created a very simple form for this page which would be easy to fill in.
