The band project
----------------

Introduction
------------
This project is about a 1960s style band called the Monkees.
I have been asked to build a website of 4 or 5 pages showcasing the Monkees.  
The primary target audience is the bands fans who want a way to see where the panasonics are performing and to know more about the members of the band.
I will include a gallery of events, some sample tracks for download and a contact link.

The UX 
-------
I started by using the 5 planes framework to design the website and then did an overall conceptual diagram
and a wireframe for each page.  These can be found in the band planning document accessed through the planning document 
which can be found in the band planning pdf document contained in this project.
User stories: 
i) The website is used to showcase the band showing some of their highlights.
ii)  The band members short biographies are available for fans to see.
iii)  The band wanted a way for fans to contact them easily so the contact form is essential.
iv) The band wanted a videos page so that fans could see some of their performances over the years.

My homepage
-------------

I started by setting up the nav elements using flexbox and then changed the colour picture to mono as 
the grey background was better suited to a mono picture.  The band is a 1960s style band so this seemed
more in line with trends.  I later decided to use a free background image from pixabay still staying with the mono theme.

I then added a menu - first I used flexbox and padded out the items.  However this looked very amateurish so I decided
to make my items go down the page, centering these, adding in a hover effect of a blue line underneath each item.  I then linked my pages together
using absolute filepaths.

My gallery page
---------------

This page was made up of a series of pictures showing past gigs for the band.
I created a responsive gallery showing pictures of the band from the past and present.

My Videos page
--------------

This page enabled the user to click on a video and view a past performance by the Monkees.
I embedded videos into this page from you tube.


My contact page
---------------
I created a very simple form for this page which would be easy to fill in.

Another feature idea for my website
-----------------------------------
If I had more time I would choose to put in a timeline for the band on a separate page.
The timeline would show events from the formation of the monkees to the present day.

Testing
-------
I tested each page as I built it and also tested it out during my mentor sessions.
I also showed the website to my family and friends as I built it and asked for suggestions
from them as to how to improve it.
I checked that my website worked on different browsers and screen sizes.

Deployment
----------

I deployed my project to github using 10 commits for the full project.
My project was commited to the master branch.

Credits
-------
All videos were from youtube.
Photographs were from code institute assets on github.
Thanks to my friends and family who supported me throughout this project.
